# TODO: Refer to the course textbook called "Doing Math with Python" to learn
# more about how to calculate the mode of a list of values

# TODO: provide all of the required imports


# TODO: define a function called calculate_mode that takes as input:
#       a List[int]
#       and produces as output:
#       a Tuple[int, int]

# TODO: calculate the mode of the values in a list of numbers
# TODO: return an ordered pair (i.e., a tuple) containing:
# (the number that is the mode, the number of times the mode appeared)

# TODO: Make sure that you understand why this conditional logic exists!

    # TODO: create a list of scores containing these values:
    # 7, 8, 9, 2, 10, 9, 9, 9
    # TODO: call the calculate_mode function with the list of scores
    # TODO: display both the mode of the list and the frequency with which it was found
